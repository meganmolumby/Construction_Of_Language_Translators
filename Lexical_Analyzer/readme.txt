i.Purpose of Project
Using the grammar definition in the appendix
Compiler Construction- Principles and Practice by Kenneth C. Louden, construct
a lexical analyzer.    
The lexical analyzer should return tokens as described. The  tokens will serve as the input to the parser. The definitions have been enhanced by adding a keyword "float"
1) comments should be totally ignored, not passed to the parser and
   not reported.
2) comments might be nested.
3) one line comments are designated by //
4) multiple line comments are designated by /* followed by */ in 
   a match up fashion for the nesting.
5) report nesting depth/declarations of Identifiers.
